# real_time_face_detection and recognition
This is a real time face detection and recognition project base  on opencv/tensorflow/mtcnn/facenet. Chinese version of description is [here](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/25025596) .Face detection is based on [MTCNN](https://kpzhang93.github.io/MTCNN_face_detection_alignment/index.html).Face embedding is based on [Facenet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.03832).

##Inspiration
The code was inspired by several projects as follows:

1.[OpenFace](https://github.com/cmusatyalab/openface). The main idea was inspired by openface. However, I prefer python and tensorflow,so there comes this project.

2.[davidsandberg/facenet](https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet).

   facenet.py was taken from https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet/blob/master/facenet/src/facenet.py
    
   nn4.py was taken from https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet/blob/master/src/models/nn4.py
    
   detect_face.py was taken from https://github.com/davidsandberg/facenet/blob/master/src/align/detect_face.py

##Dependencies
1.tensorflow
2.opencv with python bindings (cv2)
3.jupyter notebook for running .ipynb examples

##Running
1.Downloading pre-trained facenet from https://github.com/yobibyte/yobiface/blob/master/model/model-20160506.ckpt-500000 and putting in model_check_point folder.

2.Running [real time face detection and recognition.ipynb](https://github.com/shanren7/real_time_face_recognition/blob/master/real%20time%20face%20detection%20and%20%20recognition.ipynb) with jupyter notebook
